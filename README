Project Title: Simple Shell 0.1 Implementation

Project Description:
The "Simple Shell 0.1 Implementation" project aims to create a basic command line interpreter,
or shell, that provides users with a simplified interface to interact with the underlying UNIX-like operating system.
This project focuses on building a minimalistic version of a shell that can handle simple one-word commands.
The goal is to demonstrate understanding of basic system calls, input handling, error management, and basic command execution.

Conclusion:

The "Simple Shell 0.1 Implementation" project serves as an entry-level exercise in creating
a basic command line interpreter.
By focusing on fundamental aspects of input handling, command execution, and error management,
this project provides a hands-on opportunity to gain insights into the inner workings of shells
and the interaction between user commands and the operating system.
